In order to run the project some node package might need to be installed, here are a list of the commands required to install them
npm install font-awesome@4.7.0  
npm install sweetalert2  
npm install material-ui/core  
npm install material-ui/lab  

A backup of the database is a provided inside a folder called "Database" inside the MovieMania project.

PS: The thumbnails are saved as nvarbinary inside the database but I am not certain if the images will display on a non-local machine that doesn't contain the path of the images.
